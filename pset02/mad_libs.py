# Things to do:

# Define a bunch of templates in which some of the words begin with a colon (:).
# The words that begin with a colon are the words that you will ask the user
# to fill in. An example of a template is:
#
#     "The :color :animal :action over the :adjective :plant."
#
# You should define a list of at least 10 templates. Be creative!

#adjective, body part, noun, verb, adverb, color, exclamation, place, animal
templates = [
    {
        "text": " :exclamation!, a :adverb :noun with a :color :bodypart has :verb(past) the :noun.", 
        "author":":author"
}, 
    {
        "text": "The :adjective :noun seemed extra :adjective at the :place where it was :adverb :verb(ing).", 
        "author":":author"
}, 
    {
        "text": "That :animal :verb my :adjective :noun while I was :verb(ing) at the :place.", 
        "author": ":author", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": ":curse :name! I can't believe you :adverb :verb(past) my :bodypart.", 
        "author": ":author", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": "Yes officer, that :profession stole my :object and :verb(past) it  ", 
        "author": "", 
    }, 
    { # famous quotes? Philosophy?
        "text": "", 
        "author": "", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": "", 
        "author": "", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": "", 
        "author": "", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": "", 
        "author": "", 
    }, 
    {
        "text": "", 
        "author": "", 
    }
]

# Your app should begin by selecting a random template. Then, for each word
# that begins with a colon in the template, prompt the user for a word
# that fits the description. Make sure that their input is between 1 and 30
# characters long, to prevent them from making too much of a mess of things.

# After the user has filled in all of the words, print the completed
# template with the user's words filled in. Then after a blank line, print
# a line crediting the author of the template. Then, print a couple of blank
# lines and ask them if they want to play again. If they say "yes" (or "s√≠"
# or "oui") or any acceptable version of an affirmative answer, start over
# with a new random template. Otherwise, say "no", print "Thanks for playing!"
# and exit the program.

# Here are some constraints:

#   1. The templates should be a list of dictionaries, in which each entry
#      has a "text" fields and an "author" field. The "text" field should
#      contain the template string, and the "author" field should contain
#      the name of the person who wrote the template.
#
#   2. The possible "yes" answers should be stored in a set.
