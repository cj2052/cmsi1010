Problem Set 4

Created a plane lander simulation where you have to land the startship enterprise on a runway on mars. I added photos for the background and spaceship, altered the landing zone, rewrote the plane class using sprite, rewrote the rotation mechanics to work with sprite, created a score counter to keep track of the score, and created a restart option for the user to restart the game after a crash.
