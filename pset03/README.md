Problem Set 3

Practiced creating classes in classes_cardio. Created a poker game called oldpoker where I started classifying poker hands but the instructions were modified partway through so I pivoted, hence oldpoker and poker.py. Card holds the card class and methods and cards_test holds the unittest for the poker file. 

The poker game deals random hands for each player and then classifies them.
